🛋️ Interactive 3D Product Viewer

A minimalist 3D product viewer built with Three.js, featuring a detailed desk lamp assembled using basic geometry shapes. Perfect for exploring foundational concepts in 3D web development.

Features
Modular architecture — split into separate files for scene setup, lighting, model creation, interaction, and camera animation

Realistic lighting — ambient, directional, and point lights make materials shine & cast shadows

Auto-rotating camera — smoothly orbits around the model; pauses on user interaction and resumes after idle

Interactive parts — click individual lamp components (base, stand, arm, head, bulb) to highlight, scale, and display a label

Responsive design — renderer automatically adjusts on window resize
